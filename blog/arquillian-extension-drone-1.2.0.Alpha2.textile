This release breaks implementation compatibility with previous Drone releases. You should not be affected unless you use Drone combined
with other projects that depend on more then just SPI, such as Graphene 2. In such cases, we are releasing compatible releases, such as Graphene 2.0.0.Alpha4.
Those changes were done in order to make Drone more reusable by third party projects to avoid such problems in future.

I'd like to thank everybody involved in this release. _You guys make testing a breeze!_
 
We hope that you'll enjoy the improvements. We look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
